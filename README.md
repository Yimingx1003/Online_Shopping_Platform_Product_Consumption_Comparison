## How to run

This project includes an automated pipeline inside `main.py`.  
By running this file, the entire workflow will execute sequentially:

- Web scraping from Newegg — currently commented out  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Visualization generation

```bash
python main.py
```


## 📌 Project Overview

This project collects, cleans, and analyzes product data from **Newegg.com**, focusing on two hardware categories:

- **NVIDIA RTX 5090 Graphics Cards**
- **2TB Solid State Drives (SSDs)**

The goal is to perform brand-level comparisons, examine pricing and rating patterns, and visualize market trends using Python-based scraping and analytics.

## 📂 Data Sources

All product data was collected through **custom web scraping** using Python’s `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
Newegg does **not** provide a public API, so HTML parsing was required.

### CSV Data includes:
- title
- product_url
- Brand
- Price
- rating
- Number of reviews
- Shipping information

### Pages Scraped:
| Product Category | Pages | Method |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| RTX 5090 GPUs     | 8 pages | HTML scraping |
| 2TB SSDs          | 2 pages | HTML scraping |

Raw HTML is saved locally, and cleaned CSV files are generated for analysis.
